# Hi! I am Jamal Bhatti
My journey into the world of engineering and software technology began during my Aerospace Engineering studies in 2010. Faced with the tedious task of calculating flow properties from upstream and downstream of a shock wave using extensive tables, I found myself frustrated by the lack of efficient tools. This challenge sparked my initial foray into programming, leading me to automate these calculations and, inadvertently, igniting my passion for bridging the gap between engineering and software technology.

The realization that engineering and software often operate in silos, with minimal crossover in their educational paths, motivated me to delve deeper into the integration of these two fields. I've become a strong advocate for combining the expertise of different industries to forge innovative solutions. Throughout my career, I've actively sought opportunities to work across various departments, from the Institut f√ºr Statik und Dynamik to the fields of additive manufacturing and AI-driven technologies. This multidisciplinary approach has not only enriched my skill set but has also enabled me to communicate and innovate at the intersection of these domains, finding common ground among diverse technical languages.

I am driven by a singular goal: to develop cutting-edge engineering solutions through the application of software technology. My vision is to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance everyday products, making them adaptable and more responsive to changing environments. My passion extends beyond mere technology; it encompasses the potential for these innovations to positively impact our world. I am committed to continuous learning, always seeking to expand my knowledge and understanding of the latest technological advancements and their applications.

As I venture into the next phase of my career, I am eager to find opportunities that align with my unique blend of industry and academic experience. My portfolio showcases a journey of innovation, collaboration, and relentless pursuit of excellence. It reflects my dedication to leveraging technology to solve complex problems and my ability to thrive in environments that cherish new ideas and unconventional solutions to traditional challenges.

If you are seeking a dynamic individual who brings a wealth of experience in engineering, software development, and AI, coupled with a proven track record of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation, I invite you to explore my portfolio. Let's embark on a journey to redefine the boundaries of what's possible.
